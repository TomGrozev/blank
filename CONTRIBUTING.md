## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues using Blank, try one of the
following resources to get assistance. Please **do not** open a GitHub issue
except to report bugs or request features.

### GitHub Discussions

GitHub's discussions are the best place to get help or propose rough ideas for
new functionality. Their integration with GitHub allows for easily cross-
referencing and converting posts to issues as needed. There are several
categories for discussions:

- **General** - General community discussion
- **Ideas** - Ideas for new functionality that isn't yet ready for a formal
  feature request
- **Q&A** - Request help with installing or using Blank

## Reporting Bugs

- First, ensure that you're running the [latest stable version](https://github.com/TomGrozev/blank/releases)
  of Blank. If you're running an older version, it's possible that the bug has
  already been fixed.

- Next, check the GitHub [issues list](https://github.com/TomGrozev/blank/issues)
  to see if the bug you've found has already been reported. If you think you may
  be experiencing a reported issue that hasn't already been resolved, please
  click "add a reaction" in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs
  up (+1). You might also want to add a comment describing how it's affecting your
  project. This will allow us to prioritize bugs based on how many users are
  affected.

- When submitting an issue, please be as descriptive as possible. Be sure to
  provide all information request in the issue template, including:

      * The environment in which Blank is running
      * The exact steps that can be taken to reproduce the issue
      * Expected and observed behavior
      * Any error messages generated
      * Screenshots (if applicable)

- Please avoid prepending any sort of tag (e.g. "[Bug]") to the issue title.
  The issue will be reviewed by a maintainer after submission and the appropriate
  labels will be applied for categorization.

- Keep in mind that we prioritize bugs based on their severity and how much
  work is required to resolve them. It may take some time for someone to address
  your issue.

## Feature Requests

- First, check the GitHub [issues list](https://github.com/TomGrozev/blank/issues)
  to see if the feature you're requesting is already listed. (Be sure to search
  closed issues as well, since some feature requests have been rejected.) If the
  feature you'd like to see has already been requested and is open, click "add a
  reaction" in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up (+1). This
  ensures that the issue has a better chance of receiving attention. Also feel
  free to add a comment with any additional justification for the feature.
  (However, note that comments with no substance other than a "+1" will be
  deleted. Please use GitHub's reactions feature to indicate your support.)

- Before filing a new feature request, consider raising your idea in a
  [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/TomGrozev/blank/discussions)
  first. Feedback you receive there will help validate and shape the proposed
  feature before filing a formal issue.

- Good feature requests are very narrowly defined. Be sure to thoroughly
  describe the functionality and data model(s) being proposed. The more effort
  you put into writing a feature request, the better its chance is of being
  implemented. Overly broad feature requests will be closed.

- When submitting a feature request on GitHub, be sure to include all
  information requested by the issue template, including:

      * A detailed description of the proposed functionality
      * A use case for the feature; who would use it and what value it would add
        to Blank
      * A rough description of changes to versions (if applicable)
      * Any third-party libraries or other resources which would be involved

- Please avoid prepending any sort of tag (e.g. "[Feature]") to the issue
  title. The issue will be reviewed by a moderator after submission and the
  appropriate labels will be applied for categorization.

## Submitting Pull Requests

- Be sure to open an issue **before** starting work on a pull request, and
  discuss your idea with the community before beginning work. This will
  help prevent wasting time on something that we might not be able to
  implement. When suggesting a new feature, also make sure it won't conflict with
  any work that's already in progress.

- Once you've opened or identified an issue you'd like to work on, ask that it
  be assigned to you so that others are aware it's being worked on. A maintainer
  will then mark the issue as "accepted."

- Any pull request which does _not_ relate to an **accepted** issue will be closed.

- All new functionality must include relevant tests where applicable.

- When submitting a pull request, please be sure to work off of the `develop`
  branch, rather than `master`. The `develop` branch is used for ongoing
  development, while `master` is used for tagging stable releases.

- In most cases, it is not necessary to add a changelog entry: A maintainer will
  take care of this when the PR is merged. (This helps avoid merge conflicts
  resulting from multiple PRs being submitted simultaneously.)

- All code submissions should meet the following criteria (CI will enforce
  these checks):

      * Ecto syntax is valid
      * All tests pass when run with `mix test`
      * Correct formatting and is passed `mix format --check-formatted`

## Commenting

Only comment on an issue if you are sharing a relevant idea or constructive
feedback. **Do not** comment on an issue just to show your support (give the
top post a :+1: instead) or ask for an ETA. These comments will be deleted to
reduce noise in the discussion.
